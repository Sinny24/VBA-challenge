1.Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
Based on the provided data, the three conclusions that we can draw out about crowdfunding data is there was a very successful rate for funding in the theaters field. The profit rate was very high compared to the other industry. The journalism industry has a lowest successful rate compared to any other industry.



Especially when you see the graph below you can visually see that funding for a Theater Play, has a higher successful rate then a failure compared to other industries. and



2.What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset does not include most recent statistics for the current years, the lates year that has been provided is the year 2019, which was 3 years ago and due to the current circumstance of being in the pandemic, I believe if there was more accurate data the chart and graph would look a lot more different.

3.What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
Other possible tables/graphs that could be used to create the following study are; - Success of categories by countries. - Analysis of funding success and length rate, while looking at the relationship between the crowdfunding goals.
